# Tarpstone's Home Network Guide
This project grew out of a desire to do two things:

- Standup a home server for various self-hosted services I desired (music, ad-blocking, VPN, etc.)
- Install OpenWRT on our router to take full control of our home network and better support what I was doing with the server (especially once I realized my router's stock firmware was preventing me from iterating as quickly)

If you're thinking of doing either/both of these things anytime soon, I hope this Wiki will serve as a useful starter guide for you.
